# What JDK switcher is

This is a yet another Ubuntu/Debian-specific script that switches between multiple JDK
versions (including those that may not have been installed via apt).

It is meant to be used in the [travis-ci.org CI environment](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks) but
may be useful in other environments, too.

## Usage

Install one or more JDKs that register themselves with the `update-java-alternatives` tools by
installing a `.jinfo` file under `/usr/lib/jvm`.

Then source `jdk_switcher.sh` in the repository root and use the `jdk_switcher` function it two arguments,
a command and the JDK to use:

``` bash
. ./jdk_switcher.sh

jdk_switcher home oraclejdk10

jdk_switcher  use openjdk7

jdk_switcher home ibmjdk8
```

### Commands

 * `use`: switches active JDK (updates `PATH` alternatives and exports `JAVA_HOME`)
 * `home`: prints `JAVA_HOME` value for the specified JDK. Does not change anything in the environment.

### JDK aliases

Supported aliases are:

 * `oraclejdk10`
 * `oraclejdk8`
 * `oraclejdk7`
 * `openjdk7`
 * `openjdk6`
 * `ibmjdk8`


## How Does it Work?

The switcher uses [update-java-alternatives](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/update-java-alternatives.8.html) (see also [this intro](http://wiki.debian.org/Java/#Java_and_Debian)) under the hood to update `/etc/alternatives/*` symlinks for
`java`, `javac`, `javap` and other JDK tools. As such, the switcher itself primary handles aliasing of
JDKs (`update-java-alternatives` aliases are too hard to remember) and updating `JAVA_HOME` value.

`JAVA_HOME` changes is the reason why `jdk_switcher` is implemented as a function.


## Why was this tool necessary?

`JAVA_HOME` updates is the key reason for it to exist: `update-java-alternatives` and related Debian tools
in general do a great job of managing alternatives but won't touch or even define `JAVA_HOME`. Even though most
JVM ecosystem tools (from Leiningen to Elastic Search, HBase and Cassandra) will
try hard to detect `JAVA_HOME` value but unfortunately, Maven 3 does it in a way that is heavily biased
towards OpenJDK 6.

For travis-ci.org to support multiple JDKs for Clojure, Groovy, Java, Scala and JRuby, it is crucially
important that all the tools we provision will use the JDK version specified for a build. We cannot let
Maven always use OpenJDK 6.
